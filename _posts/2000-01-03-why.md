One of the reasons for having bad viewing experiences on [Twitch.tv][Twitch]{: target="_blank" } is the usage of their HTML5 or Flash video player. Especially on mobile desktop devices, high CPU and memory usage and lack of GPU acceleration of the web browser can cause major issues like buffering, stuttering or low video playback frame rates.

With Streamlink Twitch GUI you're not dependent on your web browser and streams can be watched in the video player of your choice, enabling a smooth video playback. In addition to that, variable stream buffers will help you countering bad network conditions.
